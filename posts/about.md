# About

Data Science @ SC was started in January 2019 with a mission to help UC Santa Cruz students learn practical data science, analytics and machine learning skills.

We welcome students from all majors, though you’ll have an easier time if you already have quantitative and/or programming background!

Some of the things we do

- Machine learning competitions
- Tutorial series on statistical learning theory and practical programming
- Career/resume workshops
- Guest speakers
- Socials

## Meetings

Meetings are Monday 6pm @McHenry 1270 (Down to the left near the main entrance, near the math sections)

Additional reading groups and specific projects hold extra meetings in the week.
