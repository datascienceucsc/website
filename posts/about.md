# About

Data Science @ UCSC was started in January 2019 with a mission to help 
UC Santa Cruz students learn practical data science, analytics and machine 
learning skills.

We welcome students from all majors, though you’ll have an easier time 
if you already have quantitative and/or programming background!

## Activities

Some of the events we organize:
- Guest lectures
- Machine learning competitions
- Programming workshops
- Socials
- Reading groups

## Meetings

Currently we don't meet in person due to COVID-19.

Additional reading groups and specific projects hold extra meetings in the week.

## Joining

We communicate through our Slack workspace, which you can join at [https://datascienceslugs.slack.com](https://datascienceslugs.slack.com).
